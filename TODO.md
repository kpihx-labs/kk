# Delivery State

Single source for current delivery status. Version: `Cargo.toml`.
Evidence: [verification record](docs/progress.md).

## Now

| Item | Actual state |
| --- | --- |
| Release | `0.8.2`, published on [GitHub](https://github.com/kpihx-labs/kk/releases/tag/v0.8.2) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/kpihx-labs/kk/-/releases/v0.8.2) |
| Previous draft | Signed `v0.8.1` at `fa6a29f`; retained, **not publicly released** |
| Released software | The published Linux baseline passed product, docs, audit, SDK and both hosted CI platforms |
| Final executable | Exact signed x86_64 bytes pass 25 public, 66 baseline and native contention scenarios |
| Installation | Authenticated `0.8.2` executable installed; obsolete managed `0.8.0` trashed on request, profiles preserved |
| Branch name | `main` locally and by default on GitHub/GitLab; commits/tags retained |

## Product Expansion In Progress

The working tree is newer than the installed release. Coordination, file owners
and acceptance cases live in [product workstreams](docs/workstreams.md).

| Scope | Current verification boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Live incoming files | Publication/cancellation/shutdown and lifetime-budget regressions pass; actual two-UI opt-in, denied retry and binary/empty transfer digests verified |
| Profiles and useful status | Locked updates, local member labels, CLI profile management and public-only offline/live status pass combined checks |
| Human-facing UI | Live profile-name collision/routing, local aliases and Settings-conflict controls verified; 39 static layout cases pass; broader interactive qualification remains open |
| Portable archives | TAR/ZIP transaction regressions pass; real signed 0.8.2 TAR online install, same-version reinstall/rollback verified in isolated prefix; new/raw/offline artifact gates remain open |
| Meetings and native targets | Two simultaneous synthetic UI screen publications verified; Windows foundation passes, Apple stdio runtime correction in progress; full native product not claimed |

## Not Qualified

| Scope | Work still needed |
| --- | --- |
| Windows/macOS native | Platform storage, IPC, lifecycle and real OS qualification |
| Physical media/Wayland portal | Explicitly consented hardware and portal lifecycle tests |
| Physical networks | Wi-Fi/AP isolation, sustained load and traversal evidence |

These remain outside this Linux delivery. They are not silently closed by a
compilation, virtual display or mobile layout fixture. Exact digests, CI and lab
report references are kept in the verification record, not duplicated here.
